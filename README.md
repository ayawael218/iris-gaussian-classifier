# iris-gaussian-classifier
1) Description:
    This project implements a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier on the Iris dataset, achieving high classification accuracy through feature normalization and a custom model fitting process.

2) Key Features:
  Dataset Utilization: Utilizes the Iris dataset consisting of 150 samples with 4 features, normalizing the features for enhanced model performance.
  Data Splitting: Divides the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets using a random seed for reproducibility.
  Gaussian Naive Bayes Implementation: Custom implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm, calculating class means, variances, and prior probabilities to determine class predictions.
  Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 97.78% on the test set, showcasing effective classification of the iris species.

3) Programming Tools:
    Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
